He is the son of Greg Fitzpatrick, a native American.</span></p><p><span>Also, Christian has a brother named Dez Fitzpatrick. </span><span>However, there is not much information about his parents’ personal lives and childhood.</span></p><p><span>Yet, we can trace his source of inspiration for picking up football to his background.</span></p><p><span>Christian grew up in a “sports household,” as he describes it. His father loved watching the two brothers play games. They loved to play Basketball in their driveway.</span></p><p><span>Since Dez was older than Christian, he would coach his brother. Christian recalled his brother making him train hard from an early age.</span></p><p><span>Dez would have him run gassers and cones. As a result, this was indirect training for him.</span></p><p><span>Over time, his brother developed an interest in football. Thus, they would often watch the games with their family members.</span></p><p><span>Also, he would sit on vast local grounds, watching the game that he hoped to one day dominate.</span></p><p><strong>You might also want to read about <a href=# rel=noopener>Reggie Wayne: Wife, College, Career, Football & Net Worth >></a></strong></p><h2>Christian Fitzpatrick | Career</h2><h3>Early Steps</h3><p><span>Christian Fitzpatrick attended Southfield A&T school. It was a public school in Southfield, Michigan. Also, it was famous for its football program.</span></p><p><span>The coaching team noticed Christian from the moment they walked onto the field. Christian’s strength and quickness inspired me to push him as a regular starter.</span></p><p><span>Despite being a mid-year enrollee, he got a chance to play for the Southfield team. Fitzpatrick finished his first season with 33 receptions for 611 yards and ten touchdowns. </span>Similarly, he averaged 18.5 yards per catch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Christian-Fitzpatrick2-1024x768.jpg><p><span>Hence, Chris put up impressive performances in his first season. </span><span>As a result, Rivals.com has him ranked as the 71st best wide receiver in the country and the 16th best in Michigan.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, 247Sports ranked him as the 113th-best wideout in the country. Also, they ranked him the 22nd-best player in the state.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, he was named to Metro Detroit’s 2019 Dream Team offense. Thus, Christian started getting a lot of offers from various reputed colleges.</span></p><h3>Offers from Power-Five Programs</h3><p><span>Christian received offers from many Power Fives, including Oregon, Indiana, Iowa, Illinois, etc. Thus, he decided to visit the training camps of a few of these teams.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, Christian recalls receiving around dozen offers after his season ended. It was a critical point in his career. Hence, he decided not to rush his decision.</span></p><p><span>So, on June 09, 2019, he attended the Penn State Nittany Lions camp. Similarly, he had visited a slew of other Power Five program camps.</span></p><p><span>However, he made his decision mainly based on the best passing offense.</span></p><p><span>As a result, he started talks with Washington State University. Since he believed the university was the best in his criteria.</span></p><p><span>In addition, Christian was one of three wide receiver commits in WSU’s 2020 recruiting class.</span></p><p><span>He was the highest-rated member among them all. Likewise, the wide receivers of Washington State were graduating very soon. So it guaranteed him a start in most of the regular games.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, on July 27, 2019, Christian Fitzpatrick committed to Washington State Cougars. Exactly a month later, he made an official visit to the university.</span></p><h3>Second Thoughts</h3><p><span>On October 16, 2019, sources stated Christian Fitzpatrick de-committed from Washington State Cougars. Then, Christian revealed on Twitter that he had reopened his transfer process.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, he thanked WSU head coach Mike Leach for having faith in his potential. Also, Fitzpatrick thanked the outside receivers coach Steve Spurrier Jr. for his dedication.</span></p><p><span>Christian had already made an official visit and verbal agreement. Yet, he decided to cancel his commitment. The exact reasons for withdrawing his contract are unknown.</span></p><p><span>However, many of his friends believed he wanted to play with Louisville Cardinals. Since childhood, Christian always wished he was a year older.</span></p><p><span>So that he could play with his brother Dez; additionally, his brother, Dez Fitzpatrick, played as wide receiver for the cardinals.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, these were just rumors circulating in the media. Christian didn’t give any official statements.</span></p><h3>Louisville Cardinals</h3><p><span>Louisville was a strong possibility when Christian’s recruiting began to heat up again. Yet, the 2-10 record of the Louisville team was a major issue for Christian and his family.</span></p><p><span>However, Satterfield and wide receivers coach Gunter Brewer had joined the team freshly. This interested Christian and his family.</span></p><p><span>Christian’s father watched the first three games to see how they performed.</span></p><p><span>But the Cardinals were dealing with quarterback injuries. Also, they had only played three games with their new offense. But, Greg saw the basis for something explosive.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, Christian gained first-hand information from his brother. The idea of playing football together with his brother was overwhelming.</span></p><p><span>Thus, this aided the whole transfer process to Louisville. Consequently, Christian joined Louisville Cardinals on October 20, 2019.</span></p><h3>Familiar Teammates and Setbacks</h3><p><span>Scott Satterfield was hired as the program’s head coach. The training session got clearer but harder. Continuing to develop his mechanics was his main priority throughout his first season.</span></p><p><span>Christian worked hard with his teammates in training. Consequently, Christian started getting better in speed and attack. But then, Dez Fitzpatrick admitted his brother mastered the offense faster than he did.</span></p><p><span>Their father proudly watched as Dez caught a pass and Christian laid a block for him downfield.</span></p><p><span>But, the 2020 season was a challenge for Christian. He took part in spring practices until the COVID-19 pandemic cut them short. Similarly, Christian picked up a series of injuries.</span></p><p><span>Throughout, injuries slowed him down as a freshman in 2020. As a result, he only played in one game in the regular-season finale against Wake Forest.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, he didn’t have any stats for the game.</span></p><p><strong>You might be curious to read about </strong><a href=#><strong>Daniëlle van de Donk – Early Life, Football Career & Net Worth >></strong></a></p><h3>Transfer Portal and 2021</h3><p><span>2020 was a season to forget for him.
